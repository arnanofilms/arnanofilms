Blender AR Nano Films: 10 seconds of art and fun

What is a Blender AR Nano Film and how can you create your own?

Hello, I am passionate about 3D animation and augmented reality, and I want to introduce you to a new form of art that I have discovered and that has fascinated me: the Blender AR Nano Film. If you want to know more about me, you can read my testimony here [link to testimony].

Ernest Hemingway wrote ‚ÄúFor sale: baby shoes, never worn‚Äù. It is the  nano tale of six words. It can be read in an instant. It stays in the reader‚Äôs mind. It makes the reader imagine the rest of the story. It requires creativity and language skills.

A Blender AR Nano Film is like a nano tale, but using the technology (3D productions and augmented reality) instead of words. With a length of between 5 and 10 seconds, it is seen through a device, which allows it to vary depending on user interaction. It adapts to their environment, magically appearing in the real world. It makes the viewer feel part of their story. And it requires creativity and skill with the Blender and the Augmented Reality.

Both are forms of expression that require a lot of creativity and skill, and that have a great potential to thrill and surprise.

Here I show you an example of a Blender AR Nano Film that I have created myself, using the 3D animation software Blender and the augmented reality technology:

Blender AR Nano Film Example

This Blender AR Nano Film only has 10 seconds, but it manages to create a fantastic and funny story to raise awareness about excessive alcohol and accident prevention.

Conclusion: Creating a Blender AR Nano Film is a form of artistic expression that combines 3D animation and augmented reality to create a short but impactful story. And it is an awesome and innovative resource that allows you to create immersive and interactive experiences that capture the attention and emotion of the audience, generating greater engagement with the artist and memory of a 3D production. Technically speaking, it is a WebAR experience, which is activated by simply using your cell phone and clicking on a link, without the need to scan QR codes, use AR development software, install applications or use social networks. It is 100% optimized, high-quality and high-performance for Augmented Reality on the Web.

If you liked this initiative and you want to learn how to create your own Blender AR Nano Film, I invite you to visit my web page, where I will explain everything you need to know, and show you some final results examples of my own creation.

Also, you can participate in the first Blender AR Nano Films Festival and launch yourself solo or in collaboration to create your own augmented reality nano film experience using Blender, where you can showcase your talent and passion for this art form.

No matter if you are an expert or novice, all you need is the desire to create and share. The important thing is that you have fun. If you already know how to use the tools, great. If you want to learn, even better, we will help you. You just have to have them. I‚Äôm sure you can create some amazing ‚ÄúBlender AR Nano Films‚Äù.
